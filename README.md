Assignment 4 of Android Club

In this Assignment we are supposed to create a list app using Basic Redux
\
\
For this I have chosen to make a gaming list (with gamery aesthetic and apperance ) in which anyone can add their opinions of best games to play
\
\
I have created 2 main screens here which include GameForm and GameList using the help of Part 1 of the shared tutorial which taught basic Redux operation
\
\
A detailed video of the app functioning is uploaded in the youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdK9slxER5E
\
\
Screenshots of the app's Two screeens are attached below:
